# clockapp
A small clock and stopwatch app using guipp for development

This is a simple demonstration how to use guipp for developing own applications.

To try it, do the following

- git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/r3dl3g/clockapp.git clockapp
- cd clockapp
- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake ..
- make -j

If everything went fine you should now have an executable named ClockApp in the same directory.
Call ./ClockApp to see it!
